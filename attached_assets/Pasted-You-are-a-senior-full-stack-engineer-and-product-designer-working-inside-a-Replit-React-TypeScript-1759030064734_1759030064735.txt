You are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer working inside a Replit React + TypeScript + Tailwind project named “AIDevelo.AI”. Update the codebase to implement a modern, high-converting landing page and the new modular product strategy described below. Do NOT start a brand-new project; refactor existing files where sensible and create new ones where needed.

## BRAND & GOAL
Brand: AIDevelo.AI
Value proposition: Modular AI solutions for SMEs. Customers can activate any product individually, combine freely, add/remove anytime—no unnecessary bundles.

Primary goals for this task:
1) Ship a world-class **Landing Page** (hero + product explanation + crisp visuals) in English.
2) Implement a clear **Modular Products** section: each product can be toggled/added independently.
3) Add a **simple Pricing Calculator** that sums active products and applies combo discounts (2 products = 10% off total, 3 products = 15% off total).
4) **Center the logo in the header** (desktop and mobile) and keep nav items balanced.
5) Keep code production-ready, accessible (WCAG), and responsive.

## PRODUCTS (modules, each sold separately)
- **AI Phone Agent** — answers calls, understands intents, books appointments to the customer’s calendar, creates call notes.
- **AI Website Chat Agent** — 24/7 website assistant that answers FAQs, captures leads, and can schedule appointments.
- **AI Social Media Agent** — plans/writes/posts content and replies to comments/messages across channels.

## PRICING (monthly, net, EUR)
- Phone Agent: €79
- Website Chat Agent: €49
- Social Media Agent: €59
Discounts: 2 active products → 10% off subtotal; 3 active products → 15% off subtotal.
Show: “All prices exclude VAT.” and “14-day free trial. Cancel anytime.”

## UX / CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (English copy)
- **Header**: centered brand logo, left/right balanced navigation (Features, Pricing, References, Start Free Trial). Sticky on scroll.
- **Hero**: headline “Win More Customers. Automatically. With AI.”; short subline explaining the modularity; primary CTA “Start Free Trial”, secondary “See Demo”.
- **Trust row**: brief badges (14-day guarantee, No setup fees).
- **Live Preview/Visualization**: cards or mockups that visually represent Phone/Chat/Social (clean, modern gradients, subtle animated dots/particles allowed).
- **Products section**: three cards with icon, short description, key benefits; each card has an **“Activate”** toggle; when toggled on, it adds to the pricing summary.
- **Pricing summary**: shows selected products, subtotal, discount, total per month; CTA “Continue to Checkout”.
- **References (case tiles)**: 3–6 visual tiles (placeholder images ok) with one-sentence results (e.g., “+30% appointment bookings”).
- **FAQ**: 4–6 expandable items (trial, cancellation, data privacy/DSGVO, integrations, support).
- **Footer**: links (Privacy, Imprint, Terms), small brand note.

## VISUAL & LAYOUT
- Keep the current dark, space-like aesthetic; update to modern glass/soft-shadow cards, rounded-2xl, generous spacing.
- Grid system for sections; mobile-first responsiveness.
- Animations: subtle (opacity/translate), reduced-motion friendly.
- Strong focus states, aria-labels, keyboard navigation.

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
1) **Header with centered logo**
   - Component: `src/components/ui/Header.tsx`
   - Center the logo (SVG/PNG from existing assets). Keep nav items evenly spaced; on mobile use a cleaned hamburger menu. Ensure logo stays visibly centered, not just visually offset.

2) **Landing structure**
   - Page: `src/pages/index.tsx` (or `src/app/page.tsx` if Next.js — choose the correct path based on the repo; if using Vite, keep under `src/pages` and ensure router uses it as root).
   - Sections implemented as separate components under `src/components/landing/`:
     - `Hero.tsx`
     - `ProductCards.tsx`
     - `PricingSummary.tsx`
     - `References.tsx`
     - `FAQ.tsx`
   - Keep all copy **in English** and conversion-oriented.

3) **Modular product config & pricing calc**
   - `src/lib/pricing/config.ts`
     ```ts
     export const MODULES = [
       { id: "phone", name: "AI Phone Agent", price: 79, highlights: [
         "Answers calls 24/7", "Books appointments", "Creates call notes"
       ]},
       { id: "chat", name: "AI Website Chat Agent", price: 49, highlights: [
         "Answers FAQs instantly", "Captures leads", "Schedules appointments"
       ]},
       { id: "social", name: "AI Social Media Agent", price: 59, highlights: [
         "Plans & publishes content", "Replies to comments/messages", "Grows your reach"
       ]}
     ] as const;
     ```
   - `src/lib/pricing/types.ts` with strong TS types.
   - `src/lib/pricing/calc.ts`:
     - Input: selected module IDs (string[])
     - Subtotal = sum of module prices
     - If 2 selected → 10% discount; if 3 → 15%
     - Return `{ subtotal, discountPercent, discountAmount, total }`
   - Write unit tests in `src/__tests__/pricing/calc.test.ts` (Vitest or Jest present in repo).

4) **State & persistence**
   - Maintain selected module IDs in React state (lifted to landing page).
   - Persist to `localStorage` under key `AIDeveloAI:selectedModules`.
   - On load, prefill from storage.

5) **Pricing summary + CTA**
   - `PricingSummary.tsx` reads selected modules, shows breakdown (badges) and total with discount.
   - CTA “Continue to Checkout” calls a stub `startCheckout(selectedIds, total)` in `src/lib/checkout/stripeStub.ts` (console.log + TODO).

6) **Accessibility**
   - Toggle buttons use `aria-pressed` or checkboxes with `aria-checked`.
   - Proper roles, alt text for images, skip-to-content link, keyboard navigation across toggles and CTAs.

7) **Copy (English, concise)**
   - Hero H1: “Win More Customers. Automatically. With AI.”
   - Subline: “Pick exactly what you need. Activate our AI Phone Agent, Website Chat Agent, and Social Media Agent individually — or combine them anytime.”
   - Buttons: “Start Free Trial” (primary), “See Demo” (secondary).
   - Pricing microcopy under summary: “14-day free trial. Cancel anytime. All prices exclude VAT.”

8) **Refactor policy**
   - Reuse existing components if possible (e.g., `Hero.tsx`, `Features.tsx`). If they’re outdated, create new versions with clear names under `components/landing/` and update imports.
   - Keep Tailwind config as is; only add minimal utilities if necessary.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Logo is truly centered in the header on desktop and mobile.
- Landing hero + product visualization present and responsive.
- Three product cards with activation toggles; selections persist across reloads.
- Pricing summary shows correct subtotal, 0/10/15% discount, and total.
- English copy throughout; clear CTAs; FAQ present.
- `calc.test.ts` passes for cases: [], ["phone"], ["phone","chat"], ["phone","chat","social"] with totals 0, 79, 115.2, 158.95 respectively.
- No TypeScript errors; no Tailwind class collisions; Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90.

## DELIVERABLES
- New/updated files per above paths.
- Clean, modern UI with subtle animations.
- Short README comment at top of `index.tsx` with how to edit modules (via `config.ts`) and where to wire checkout later.

Proceed to implement now, modifying existing files in this Replit project. Keep commits cohesive and self-descriptive.
